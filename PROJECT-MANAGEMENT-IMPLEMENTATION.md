# Project Management System Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a multi-canvas project management system with private/public sharing, complete CRUD operations, and updated routing from `/dashboard` to `/projects/[projectId]`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (convex/schema.ts)
- **Added `projects` table** with name, ownerId, isPublic, timestamps, and thumbnail
- **Updated `shapes` table** to include projectId foreign key and project-specific indexes
- **Updated `presence` table** to include projectId for per-project user tracking

### 2. Backend Operations

#### convex/projects.ts (NEW)
- `createProject` - Create new private projects
- `updateProject` - Update name and visibility (owner only)
- `deleteProject` - Delete project with all shapes (owner only)
- `duplicateProject` - Clone project with all shapes
- `getMyProjects` - List user's projects (sorted by lastModified)
- `getProject` - Get single project with permission check
- `checkProjectAccess` helper - Enforces private/public permissions

#### convex/shapes.ts (UPDATED)
- Added `projectId` parameter to all mutations and queries
- Added `checkProjectAccess` permission checks to all operations
- Updated `getShapes` to filter by project
- Updated `reorderShapes` to require projectId

#### convex/presence.ts (UPDATED)
- Added `projectId` parameter to all operations
- Updated indexes to track users per-project
- Filtered `getActiveUsers` by projectId

### 3. Hooks

#### hooks/useProject.ts (NEW)
- `useProject(projectId)` - Single project operations
- `useProjects()` - Project list management
- Provides create, update, delete, duplicate functions

#### hooks/useShapes.ts (UPDATED)
- Now accepts `projectId` parameter
- Passes projectId to all Convex operations
- Added projectId validation

#### hooks/usePresence.ts (UPDATED)
- Now accepts `projectId` parameter
- Passes projectId to join, update, heartbeat, leave operations
- Updated all event handlers

### 4. UI Components

#### components/projects/ProjectDialogs.tsx (NEW)
- `NewProjectDialog` - Create project modal
- `RenameProjectDialog` - Rename project modal
- `DeleteConfirmDialog` - Delete confirmation modal

#### components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx (NEW)
- Project card with thumbnail, name, last modified
- Three-dot menu: Rename, Duplicate, Toggle Public, Delete
- Public/Private indicator

#### components/projects/ProjectHeader.tsx (NEW)
- Back to Projects button
- Project name display
- Share button with visibility toggle (owner only)
- Copy link button for public projects
- Public indicator for non-owners

### 5. Pages

#### app/projects/page.tsx (NEW)
- Server component with auth check
- Renders ProjectsClient

#### app/projects/ProjectsClient.tsx (NEW)
- Projects grid with search
- New Project button
- Integrates all project dialogs
- Handles all CRUD operations

#### app/projects/[projectId]/page.tsx (NEW)
- Dynamic route for individual projects
- Server component with auth check
- Renders DashboardClient with projectId

#### app/dashboard/page.tsx (UPDATED)
- Now redirects to /projects

### 6. DashboardClient.tsx (UPDATED)
- Now accepts `projectId` prop
- Integrated ProjectHeader component
- Added project data loading
- Added toggle public functionality
- Passes projectId to useShapes and usePresence

## Routing Changes

**Old:** `/dashboard` - Single shared canvas

**New:**
- `/projects` - Project list page
- `/projects/[projectId]` - Individual project canvas
- `/dashboard` - Redirects to `/projects`

## Permission Model

### Private Projects (default)
- Only owner can view/edit
- Not accessible via URL by non-owners
- Owner can toggle to public

### Public Projects
- Anyone with URL can view/edit
- Shareable link available
- Owner can toggle back to private

## Database Migration

Since this is a dev environment, the user confirmed we can:
1. Clear the database (`npx convex dev --clear`)
2. Deploy new schema
3. Start fresh with project-based structure

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test:
- [ ] Create new project
- [ ] Rename project
- [ ] Toggle project public/private
- [ ] Delete project (confirms all shapes deleted)
- [ ] Duplicate project (all shapes copied)
- [ ] Open project in 2 browser tabs (test multiplayer per-project)
- [ ] Test permission: non-owner cannot access private project
- [ ] Test permission: non-owner CAN access public project
- [ ] Test navigation: back to projects list works
- [ ] Test URL sharing: public link works in incognito
- [ ] Test AI commands still work with new projectId structure
- [ ] Test undo/redo still works
- [ ] Test copy/paste still works
- [ ] Test layers panel with projectId

## Next Steps

1. **Clear Database:** Run `npx convex dev --clear` to wipe existing data
2. **Deploy Schema:** Run `npm run dev` to deploy new schema
3. **Create Test Project:** Create your first project via UI
4. **Test Features:** Go through testing checklist above
5. **Fix Any Issues:** Address any errors that arise

## Performance Notes

- Projects query uses indexes for fast filtering
- Shapes query uses `by_project` index for efficient filtering
- Presence query uses `by_project` index for per-project isolation
- Small scale (5-10 projects, 10 concurrent users) - no optimization needed yet

## Known Limitations

- No project thumbnail auto-generation yet (shows first letter of name)
- No project search pagination (loads all projects - fine for small scale)
- No project sharing with specific users (only public/private toggle)
- No project templates or starter canvases

## Future Enhancements

- Auto-generate thumbnails from canvas snapshots
- Project templates library
- Invite-based collaborators (not just public/private)
- Project folders/categories
- Project export/import
- Version history (already planned in Priority-Features-Plan.md)
