- "Make a navigation bar with 4 menu items"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" errors
- Ensure Clerk environment variables are set correctly
- Sign in at `/sign-in` before accessing dashboard
- Verify `bunx convex dev` is running

### Shapes not syncing between users
- Check Convex dashboard for mutation errors
- Verify both users are authenticated
- Ensure `bunx convex dev` is running

### AI commands not working
- Verify OpenAI API key is set in `.env.local`
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you have OpenAI credits available

### Canvas performance issues
- Limit canvas to <500 shapes for optimal performance
- Clear shapes with "Delete all" (future feature)
- Refresh page if lag persists

### 3. AI Development Log
**Complexity**: Low
**Files**: `AI_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`

**Requirements** (ANY 3 of 5 sections):
1. Tools & Workflow used
2. 3-5 effective prompting strategies
3. Code analysis (% AI-generated vs hand-written)
4. Strengths & limitations
5. Key learnings

**Content Outline**:

```markdown
# AI Development Log

## 1. Tools & Workflow Used

### Primary Tools
- **Claude Code (via claude.ai/code)**: Primary coding assistant
  - Used for: Initial setup, component scaffolding, debugging
  - Integration: Terminal-based workflow with file editing

- **GitHub Copilot**: In-editor autocomplete
  - Used for: Boilerplate code, type definitions, repetitive patterns

- **ChatGPT (GPT-4)**: Architecture planning and problem-solving
  - Used for: High-level design decisions, algorithm suggestions

### Workflow
1. **Planning**: Use Claude/ChatGPT to break down features into tasks
2. **Scaffolding**: Generate component boilerplate with AI
3. **Implementation**: Write core logic with AI assistance (Copilot autocomplete)
4. **Debugging**: Use Claude to analyze errors and suggest fixes
5. **Refactoring**: AI-assisted code cleanup and optimization

---

## 2. Effective Prompting Strategies

### Strategy 1: Contextual Priming
**Approach**: Provide full context before asking for code

**Example**:
> "I'm building a real-time collaborative canvas with Convex and Fabric.js. I need a hook that manages undo/redo history using the command pattern. The hook should track 25 operations max and support undo/redo via commands. Here's my existing shape mutation setup: [paste code]"

**Why it worked**: AI understood the full stack and constraints, produced code that integrated seamlessly.

---

### Strategy 2: Iterative Refinement
**Approach**: Start broad, then refine with follow-ups

**Example**:
> Initial: "Create a color picker component"
> Refinement 1: "Add hex input field validation"
> Refinement 2: "Make it work with multi-select shapes"

**Why it worked**: Avoided overwhelming AI with all requirements at once, easier to spot issues early.

---

### Strategy 3: Error-Driven Debugging
**Approach**: Paste full error messages and ask for diagnosis

**Example**:
> "Getting this error: [paste stack trace]. Here's the relevant code: [paste]. What's causing this and how do I fix it?"

**Why it worked**: AI quickly identified the root cause (missing null check) that I'd been debugging for 20 minutes.

---

### Strategy 4: Architecture-First
**Approach**: Ask for design before implementation

**Example**:
> "What's the best way to implement undo/redo in a real-time collaborative canvas? Compare command pattern vs state snapshots."

**Why it worked**: AI provided trade-offs, helped me make informed decisions before writing code.

---

### Strategy 5: Test Case Generation
**Approach**: Ask AI to generate test scenarios

**Example**:
> "What edge cases should I test for multi-user shape editing with last-write-wins conflict resolution?"

**Why it worked**: AI identified scenarios I hadn't considered (delete vs edit, create collision).

---

## 3. Code Analysis

### Estimated Breakdown
- **AI-Generated (with edits)**: ~60%
  - Component boilerplate
  - Type definitions
  - Hook scaffolding
  - Utility functions
  - Initial Convex schema

- **Hand-Written**: ~40%
  - Core canvas interaction logic (Fabric.js integration)
  - AI command executor (highly custom)
  - Performance optimizations
  - Bug fixes and edge cases

### Key AI Contributions
- Undo/redo command pattern implementation (90% AI)
- Color picker component (80% AI)
- OpenAI function definitions (70% AI, refined by me)
- Multi-select logic (50% AI, 50% custom Fabric.js integration)

### Key Human Contributions
- Canvas event handlers (Fabric.js-specific)
- Throttling and performance tuning
- Multiplayer sync edge cases
- UI/UX polish and animations

---

## 4. Strengths & Limitations

### Where AI Excelled

**Pattern Implementation**
- Excellent at implementing well-known patterns (command pattern, hooks)
- Generated clean, type-safe TypeScript

**Boilerplate Reduction**
- Saved hours on component scaffolding, type definitions
- Great for repetitive tasks (CRUD mutations, form inputs)

**Documentation**
- Generated clear JSDoc comments and README sections
- Explained complex concepts (conflict resolution, real-time sync)

**Debugging**
- Quickly identified common errors (missing dependencies, type mismatches)
- Suggested fixes that worked 80% of the time

---

### Where AI Struggled

**Library-Specific Knowledge**
- Fabric.js integration required manual research and experimentation
- AI suggested outdated Fabric.js v5 patterns (we're using v6)

**Performance Optimization**
- AI didn't proactively suggest throttling or batching
- Had to manually identify and fix performance bottlenecks

**Edge Cases**
- Missed multi-user edge cases (delete while editing, concurrent updates)
- Required manual testing and fixes

**Creative Problem-Solving**
- AI good at "how" but not "what" or "why"
- Still needed human judgment for architecture decisions

---

## 5. Key Learnings

### Technical Learnings

**1. AI is a Multiplier, Not a Replacement**
- AI 10x faster for boilerplate, but core logic still requires deep understanding
- Can't blindly trust AI output - must review and test thoroughly

**2. Context is Everything**
- Providing full context (stack, constraints, existing code) dramatically improves output
- Vague prompts → vague code

**3. Iterative is Better Than Perfect**
- Better to get working code fast, then refine
- AI enables rapid prototyping and experimentation

**4. Library Docs > AI for Specifics**
- For library-specific features (Fabric.js, Convex), docs more reliable
- Use AI for general patterns, docs for specifics

---

### Process Learnings

**1. Test AI Code Immediately**
- Don't stack multiple AI-generated components before testing
- Easier to debug one piece at a time

**2. Use AI for Learning**
- Ask "why" and "how it works" to understand generated code
- AI as a teaching tool, not just code generator

**3. Keep Humans in the Loop**
- Critical decisions (architecture, data models) need human judgment
- AI great for execution, human needed for strategy

---

### Future Improvements

**What I'd Do Differently**:
1. Use AI to generate test cases earlier (caught bugs late)
2. Ask for performance considerations upfront (retrofitted later)
3. Request multiple implementation options before committing

**What Worked Well**:
1. Using AI for documentation (saved hours)
2. Error-driven debugging (cut debug time in half)
3. Iterative refinement (avoided over-engineering)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] ANY 3 of 5 sections completed
- [ ] Meaningful reflection (not generic)
- [ ] Honest assessment of AI use
- [ ] Specific examples provided

**Rubric Impact**: Pass/Fail (required for submission)

---
