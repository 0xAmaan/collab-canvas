# Implementation Summary: Real-time Sync Fix & Delete Feature

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Real-time Shape Synchronization

**Problem:** Shapes only appeared in other browsers after manual refresh. Position updates weren't syncing live.

**Root Cause:** The sync effect in `Canvas.tsx` only added new shapes but never updated existing shapes when their positions changed.

**Solution:** Modified the sync effect (lines 420-465) to:
- Build a map of Fabric objects by shape ID for efficient lookups
- **Update existing shapes** when their positions change using `updateFabricRect`
- Add new shapes (existing behavior)
- Remove deleted shapes from canvas
- Skip updating shapes being actively dragged to avoid conflicts

**Files Modified:**
- `components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` - Updated sync effect and imported `updateFabricRect`

### 2. Added Delete Functionality

**Problem:** Users couldn't delete shapes using Delete or Backspace keys.

**Solution:** Wired up existing infrastructure:
- Added `handleDeleteSelected` callback in Canvas component
- Connected Delete/Backspace keyboard shortcuts in Dashboard
- Passes delete handler from Canvas to Dashboard via props

**Files Modified:**
- `components/canvas/Canvas.tsx`:
  - Added `deleteShapeInConvex` to useShapes destructuring
  - Created `handleDeleteSelected` function
  - Added `onDeleteSelected` prop to pass handler to parent
  - Added useEffect to pass handler up on mount

- `app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`:
  - Added `deleteHandler` state
  - Added `onDelete` and `onBackspace` to useKeyboard hook
  - Passed `onDeleteSelected` callback to Canvas component

## How It Works

### Real-time Sync Flow
1. User A moves a shape → Local Fabric.js updates immediately
2. Position syncs to Convex via `moveShape` mutation
3. Convex broadcasts change to all clients
4. User B's `useQuery(api.shapes.getShapes)` receives updated data
5. ✅ **NEW:** Sync effect detects change and calls `updateFabricRect` to update position
6. User B sees shape move in real-time!

### Delete Flow
1. User selects shape and presses Delete/Backspace
2. Keyboard hook calls `deleteHandler`
3. Handler gets active object's shape ID
4. Calls `deleteShapeInConvex` mutation
5. Convex broadcasts deletion to all clients
6. Sync effect removes shape from all canvases

## Testing Checklist

### Real-time Sync
- [ ] Open two browser tabs with different accounts
- [ ] Create shape in tab 1 → Should appear immediately in tab 2
- [ ] Move shape in tab 1 → Should move in real-time in tab 2
- [ ] No manual refresh needed

### Delete Feature
- [ ] Select a shape (click on it)
- [ ] Press Delete key → Shape should disappear
- [ ] Press Backspace key → Shape should disappear
- [ ] Deletion should sync across all connected clients in real-time

## Technical Details

**Key Changes:**
- `updateFabricRect` function now being used (was previously unused)
- Map-based lookup for O(1) shape updates
- Active object detection prevents jarring updates during drag
- Database shape set for efficient deletion detection

**TypeScript:** ✅ All type checks pass
**Linting:** ✅ No new errors introduced
