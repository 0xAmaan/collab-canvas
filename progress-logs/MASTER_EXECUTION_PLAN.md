---

## Phase Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Canvas Foundation ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Goal**: Add core shape types and essential features
**Points**: +3-6 pts (Section 2)
**Duration**: Should be completed first

**Features** (in dependency order):
1. Circle/Ellipse shape (**Low complexity**, independent)
2. Line shape (**Low-Medium complexity**, independent)
3. Color picker (**Low complexity**, independent)
4. Connection indicator (**Trivial complexity**, independent)
5. Text shape (**Medium complexity**, depends on color picker)
6. Copy/Paste (**Low-Medium complexity**, depends on shapes)
7. Multi-select (**Medium complexity**, depends on all shapes)

**Branching**:
```
main
├── feature/circle-shape (parallel)
├── feature/line-shape (parallel)
├── feature/color-picker (parallel)
├── feature/connection-indicator (parallel)
└── feature/text-shape → feature/copy-paste → feature/multi-select (sequential)
```

**Merge Order**:
1. connection-indicator → main (no conflicts)
2. color-picker → main (minimal conflicts)
3. circle-shape → main
4. line-shape → main
5. text-shape → main (may conflict in Canvas.tsx)
6. copy-paste → main
7. multi-select → main (will conflict in Canvas.tsx, merge last)

---

### Phase 2: Advanced Tier 1 Features ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Goal**: Add Figma-inspired UX features
**Points**: +4-6 pts (Section 3)
**Duration**: After Phase 1 shapes complete

**Features**:
1. Undo/Redo (**Medium complexity**, wraps all operations)
2. Alt+Drag Duplicate (**Low complexity**, leverages copy/paste)
3. Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts (**Low complexity**, extends existing)

**Branching**:
```
main (with Phase 1 merged)
└── feature/undo-redo → feature/enhanced-shortcuts (sequential)
```

**Notes**:
- Undo/redo MUST be merged before AI agent (so AI commands can be undone later)
- Alt+drag can be part of copy/paste branch

---

### Phase 3: AI Canvas Agent ⭐⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Goal**: Build AI-powered shape generation
**Points**: +15-18 pts (Section 4) - BIGGEST IMPACT
**Duration**: After Phase 1 complete (can start building in parallel)

**Features**:
1. OpenAI integration (**Low complexity**)
2. AI Input UI (**Low-Medium complexity**)
3. Function/tool definitions (**Medium complexity**)
4. Command executor (**Medium-High complexity**)
5. 6+ command implementations (**Medium complexity**)

**Branching**:
```
main (with Phase 1 merged)
└── feature/ai-agent (isolated, can build in parallel)
```

**Dependencies**:
- Needs all shape types from Phase 1
- Can start building before Phase 1 merges (just merge Phase 1 into ai-agent branch)
- Relatively isolated (new lib/ai/ and components/ai/)

**Critical**: This is 25% of your total grade. Prioritize getting this working.

---

### Phase 4: Performance & Testing ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Goal**: Validate performance and document conflict resolution
**Points**: +0-4 pts (Section 1 & 2 improvements)
**Duration**: Can be done incrementally alongside feature development

**Tasks**:
1. Document conflict resolution (**Trivial**, +4-5 pts in Section 1)
2. Performance testing (**Low**, validate existing performance)
3. Multi-user testing (**Low**, validate existing multiplayer)
4. Conflict scenario testing (**Low-Medium**, validate rubric scenarios)

**Branching**:
- No branch needed (documentation + testing)
- Can create temporary test utilities on feature branches

**Notes**:
- This phase validates work, doesn't add new features
- Can be done in parallel with feature development
- Document as you go (don't leave for end)

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment ⭐⭐ CRITICAL (REQUIRED)
**Goal**: Complete submission requirements
**Points**: +2-3 pts (Section 6) + PASS (Sections 7 & 8, avoid -10 penalty)
**Duration**: Final 2-3 hours before submission

**Tasks**:
1. Enhanced README (**Low**)
2. Architecture docs (**Low**)
3. AI Development Log (**Low**, 3/5 sections required)
4. Demo video (**Low-Medium**, 3-5 min)
5. Deployment verification (**Low**)

**Branching**:
- No branch needed (documentation)
- Update docs on main after all features merged

**Critical**:
- Demo video is REQUIRED (Pass/Fail, -10 pts if missing)
- AI Development Log is REQUIRED (Pass/Fail)
- Don't skip this phase!

---

## Recommended Execution Timeline

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/<feature-name>
fix/<bug-name>
docs/<doc-name>
```

### Branch Dependencies

**Wave 1 - Independent (can work in parallel)**:
- feature/circle-shape
- feature/line-shape
- feature/color-picker
- feature/connection-indicator

**Wave 2 - Depends on Wave 1**:
- feature/text-shape (needs color-picker)
- feature/copy-paste (needs all shapes)

**Wave 3 - Depends on Wave 2**:
- feature/multi-select (needs all shapes + copy/paste)
- feature/undo-redo (needs all operations finalized)
- feature/ai-agent (needs all shapes, can start building in parallel)

### Merge Conflict Hotspots

**High Conflict Risk**:
- `components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` - Almost every feature touches this
- `convex/schema.ts` - All shape types modify this
- `components/toolbar/Toolbar.tsx` - All tools modify this
- `hooks/useKeyboard.ts` - All shortcuts modify this

**Conflict Mitigation**:
1. **Merge frequently** - Don't let branches diverge
2. **Modular code** - Use switch/case for shape types (easy to merge)
3. **Communication** - Document what each branch changes
4. **Test after merge** - Verify nothing broke

### Merge Strategy

**For Each Feature Branch**:
1. Ensure all tests pass locally
2. Merge latest main into feature branch first
3. Resolve conflicts in feature branch
4. Test again after resolving conflicts
5. Create PR (even if solo, for documentation)
6. Merge to main
7. Delete feature branch

**For Parallel Branches**:
1. Merge smallest/simplest first (connection-indicator)
2. Merge independent features next (color-picker, shapes)
3. Merge dependent features last (multi-select, undo-redo)

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **AI Agent complexity** - Most complex feature, highest points
   - Mitigation: Start early, test incrementally, have fallback (simpler commands)

2. **Merge conflicts** - Multiple branches touching Canvas.tsx
   - Mitigation: Merge frequently, keep changes modular

3. **Time pressure** - 3 days is tight
   - Mitigation: Focus on C-level first, defer polish

4. **Demo video** - Required, -10 pts if missing
   - Mitigation: Record early, can re-record if needed

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Performance testing** - May discover issues late
   - Mitigation: Test incrementally as features added

2. **Undo/redo complexity** - Command pattern can be tricky
   - Mitigation: Start with simple implementation, enhance later

3. **Multi-select interactions** - Fabric.js can be finicky
   - Mitigation: Use Fabric's built-in ActiveSelection

### Low-Risk Items
1. **Shape types** - Straightforward Fabric.js objects
2. **Color picker** - Simple UI component
3. **Documentation** - Just writing, no code risk

1. **AI Agent** (25 pts) - Must have, even if basic
   - Minimum: 6 commands that work 60% of the time
   - Defer: Advanced selector parsing, complex components

2. **Canvas Features** (20 pts) - Foundation
   - Minimum: Circle, line, text (3 shape types)
   - Defer: Multi-select, advanced interactions

3. **Documentation** (5 pts + Pass/Fail) - Required
   - Minimum: README, AI_DEVELOPMENT_LOG, Demo video
   - Defer: Detailed architecture docs

4. **Advanced Features** (15 pts) - Nice to have
   - Minimum: Undo/redo OR color picker
   - Defer: Everything else

5. **Performance** (within Section 2) - Validation
   - Minimum: Test with 100 objects
   - Defer: 500 object stress testing

**Emergency C-Level Path** (if 12 hours left):
- 6 hours: AI agent (basic commands)
- 2 hours: 1-2 more shape types
- 2 hours: Documentation + demo video
- 2 hours: Testing and debugging
**Estimated**: 65-75 points (still passing!)

---

## Final Notes

### Key Success Factors
1. **Focus on points** - AI agent is 25% of grade, prioritize it
2. **Test incrementally** - Don't stack untested code
3. **Merge frequently** - Avoid merge hell at the end
4. **Document as you go** - Don't leave docs for last minute
5. **Record video early** - Can always re-record, but have backup

### What to Avoid
1. **Perfectionism** - C-level is success, can improve later
2. **Scope creep** - Stick to must-haves, defer nice-to-haves
3. **Working in silos** - Test multiplayer frequently
4. **Ignoring video** - It's required, -10 pts if missing!

### When to Ask for Help
- Stuck on feature for >30 min → Ask for guidance
- Merge conflict you can't resolve → Ask for help
- Performance issue blocking progress → Ask for optimization advice
