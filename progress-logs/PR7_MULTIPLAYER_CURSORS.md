# PR #7: Multiplayer Cursors - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

## Overview

Implemented real-time multiplayer cursor tracking that displays cursor positions for all connected users on the canvas with smooth movement and color-coded identification.

## Files Created

### 1. `/types/presence.ts`
- Defined `Presence` interface matching Convex schema
- Defined `CursorPosition` type with x/y coordinates
- Defined `ActiveUser` interface for filtered presence data
- Exported all types for use across the application

### 2. `/hooks/useThrottle.ts`
- Custom throttle hook implementation (no external dependencies)
- Configurable delay parameter (50ms for cursor updates)
- Proper cleanup on unmount
- Handles high-frequency updates efficiently

### 3. `/hooks/usePresence.ts`
- Subscribes to `getActiveUsers` query from Convex
- Wraps all presence mutations: `updatePresence`, `joinCanvas`, `leaveCanvas`, `heartbeat`
- Implements throttled cursor position updates (50ms)
- Handles joining/leaving canvas lifecycle
- Implements 5-second heartbeat interval
- Filters out current user from active users list
- Includes `beforeunload` cleanup handler

### 4. `/components/canvas/MultiplayerCursor.tsx`
- Renders SVG cursor icon at remote user position
- Displays user name label next to cursor
- Applies user's color from 3-color palette using `getUserColor` utility
- Transforms cursor position from canvas coordinates to screen coordinates
- Uses CSS transitions for smooth cursor movement (100ms)
- Positioned absolutely on canvas with proper z-index
- Includes visibility check to hide off-screen cursors

## Files Modified

### 1. `/types/index.ts`
- Added export for presence types

### 2. `/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx`
**Added imports:**
- `usePresence` hook
- `getUserColor` utility
- `MultiplayerCursor` component

**Updated component:**
- Added `userName` prop to CanvasProps
- Integrated `usePresence` hook with user color assignment
- Added cursor position tracking in `mouse:move` event handler
- Renders `MultiplayerCursor` components for all remote users
- Added "Users Online" count to debug overlay
- Fixed variable redeclaration in mouse event handlers

### 3. `/components/canvas/index.ts`
- Added export for `MultiplayerCursor` component

### 4. `/app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`
- Passed `userName` prop to Canvas component

## Key Implementation Details

### Cursor Position Tracking
- Cursor positions are tracked on every mouse move event
- Updates are throttled to 50ms to reduce network traffic
- Positions are stored in canvas coordinates (not screen coordinates)

### Viewport Transformation
Cursor positions stored in canvas coordinates are transformed to screen coordinates based on the current viewport:
```typescript
const vpt = canvas.viewportTransform || [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0];
const screenX = cursorX * vpt[0] + vpt[4];
const screenY = cursorY * vpt[3] + vpt[5];
```

### Color Assignment
- Uses `getUserColor(userId)` from `lib/color-utils.ts`
- Consistently assigns colors from the 3-color palette (blue, purple, red)
- Same user always gets the same color based on userId hash

### Presence Lifecycle
1. **Join:** Called on Canvas mount, creates presence record in Convex
2. **Update:** Throttled cursor position updates on mouse move
3. **Heartbeat:** Every 5 seconds to keep presence alive
4. **Leave:** Called on unmount and page unload (best effort)

### Stale Presence Cleanup
- Convex cron job runs every 10 seconds
- Removes presence records with `lastActive` > 30 seconds ago
- Ensures users who didn't properly leave are cleaned up

## Technical Highlights

1. **Custom Throttle Implementation:** No external dependencies, clean React hooks pattern
2. **Optimistic UI:** Cursors render immediately with smooth CSS transitions
3. **Viewport Awareness:** Cursors properly transform with pan/zoom operations
4. **Performance:** Throttled updates minimize network traffic and database writes
5. **Resilience:** Best-effort cleanup with fallback cron job

## Testing Checklist

The following tests should be performed:

- [ ] Open two browser windows with different users
- [ ] Move cursor in window 1 → verify cursor appears in window 2
- [ ] Verify cursor has user name label
- [ ] Verify each user has different color from palette
- [ ] Verify cursor movement is smooth (no jitter)
- [ ] Measure cursor update latency (<50ms target)
- [ ] Close window → verify cursor disappears
- [ ] Test with 5+ users simultaneously
- [ ] Verify cursors transform correctly with pan/zoom
- [ ] Test heartbeat: verify stale cursors are removed after 30 seconds
- [ ] Test with slow network (throttling in DevTools)

## Known Limitations

1. **Page Unload Cleanup:** The `beforeunload` event is best-effort only. Browsers may not fire it reliably, so the cron job is the primary cleanup mechanism.

2. **Cursor Latency:** Target is <50ms but actual latency depends on:
   - Network conditions
   - Convex processing time
   - Throttle delay (50ms)

3. **Color Collisions:** With only 3 colors, multiple users may have the same cursor color in sessions with 4+ users.

## Next Steps (PR #8)

The next PR will implement the Presence Panel:
- Display list of all active users in a sidebar
- Show user avatars from Clerk
- Display online status indicators
- Show user count
