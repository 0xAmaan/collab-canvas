# V Key Select Tool Fix - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  

---

## Problem

**Issue**: Pressing 'V' key while in Hand mode (or any other tool) doesn't switch to the Select/Move tool.

**Root Cause**: The 'V' key was not mapped to the SELECT_TOOL action in the keyboard shortcuts configuration. Only 'Escape' was mapped to switch to select tool.

**Inconsistency**: The toolbar UI showed "V" as the shortcut for Move/Select tool, but the keyboard handler didn't recognize it.

---

## Solution

Added 'V' key mapping to SELECT_TOOL action in `constants/keyboard.ts`.

### Code Change

**File**: `constants/keyboard.ts`

**Added** (at beginning of KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS array):
```typescript
{
  key: "v",
  displayKey: "V",
  action: KeyboardAction.SELECT_TOOL,
  description: "Switch to select/move tool",
  requiresSelection: false,
},
```

## How It Works

### Keyboard Handler Flow

1. **User presses 'V'** (without modifiers)
2. Handler checks for ⌘V first (paste) → No match, continue
3. Handler looks up 'v' in shortcuts → Finds SELECT_TOOL action
4. Triggers `onSelectTool()` callback
5. DashboardClient switches `activeTool` to "select"

### Keyboard Handler Flow (with Cmd)

1. **User presses '⌘V'** 
2. Handler checks for ⌘V first (paste) → **Match!**
3. Triggers `onPaste()` callback → **Returns early**
4. Never reaches tool selection logic
5. Paste action executes

### No Conflict

The key handling is sequential:
- **⌘V** (with modifier) → Handled first, returns early → Paste
- **V** (no modifier) → Falls through to tool selection → Select tool

This is the same pattern used for:
- **⌘C** → Copy, **C** → Circle tool
- **⌘D** → Duplicate, **D** → (not used)
- **⌘Z** → Undo, **Z** → (not used)

## Testing

### ✅ V Key Behavior
- [x] Press 'V' from any tool → Switches to Select/Move tool
- [x] Press 'V' from Hand tool → Switches to Select/Move tool
- [x] Press 'V' from Rectangle tool → Switches to Select/Move tool
- [x] Toolbar shortcut label matches actual behavior

### ✅ No Paste Conflict
- [x] Press '⌘V' → Still pastes copied shapes
- [x] Press 'V' alone → Switches to select tool (not paste)
- [x] Both shortcuts work independently

### ✅ Other Tools (no regression)
- [x] 'H' still switches to Hand tool
- [x] 'R' still switches to Rectangle tool
- [x] 'Escape' still switches to Select tool
- [x] All tool shortcuts work

## Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

### Tool Selection (Single Keys)
- **V** → Select/Move tool ✨ NEW
- **H** → Hand/Pan tool
- **R** → Rectangle tool
- **C** → Circle tool
- **E** → Ellipse tool
- **L** → Line tool
- **T** → Text tool
- **Escape** → Select/Move tool (alternative)

### Actions (With Cmd/Ctrl)
- **⌘C** → Copy
- **⌘V** → Paste
- **⌘D** → Duplicate
- **⌘Z** → Undo
- **⌘⇧Z** → Redo

No conflicts! Each key combination has a unique action.

## Figma Compatibility

This change brings CollabCanvas closer to Figma's keyboard shortcuts:
- ✅ **V** → Move/Select tool (matches Figma)
- ✅ **H** → Hand tool (matches Figma)
- ✅ Tool shortcuts are single letters (matches Figma)
- ✅ Escape returns to select mode (matches Figma)

---

## Files Modified

1. **constants/keyboard.ts**
   - Added 'V' key mapping for SELECT_TOOL action
   - No other changes needed

---

## Why This Works

The keyboard handler in `useKeyboard.ts` already has proper logic:

1. **Early returns** for modifier key combinations (⌘V, ⌘C, etc.)
2. **Tool selection logic** falls through for single keys
3. **No hasModifier check** on SELECT_TOOL case (correct!)

This means:
- **V alone** → Tool selection → Select tool ✓
- **⌘V** → Early return → Paste ✓
- **Shift+V** → Tool selection → Select tool ✓
- **Alt+V** → Tool selection → Select tool ✓

Only **⌘V** triggers paste, all other variations trigger select tool.

---

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **V from any tool**: Switches to select  
✅ **⌘V from any tool**: Pastes (if clipboard has data)  
✅ **V while typing**: Ignored (input field check)  
✅ **Multiple V presses**: Each switches to select (idempotent)

---

## User Experience

### Before Fix
```
User: *Presses V while in Hand mode*
Result: Nothing happens
User: "Why isn't this working? The UI says V!"
```

### After Fix
```
User: *Presses V while in Hand mode*
Result: Switches to Select/Move tool
User: "Perfect! Just like Figma!"
```

## Documentation

The 'V' shortcut now appears in:
- ✅ Toolbar tooltip (already there)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts help modal (auto-generated from constants)
- ✅ Consistent across all UI

---

## Conclusion

Simple one-line fix that adds the expected 'V' key shortcut for the Select/Move tool. No conflicts with ⌘V paste, no regressions, and brings CollabCanvas in line with Figma's UX patterns.

**Impact**: 🎯 High - Users expect 'V' to work for select tool  
**Risk**: ⚠️ None - Proper sequencing prevents conflicts  
**Lines Changed**: 1 entry added to keyboard shortcuts array  

The 'V' key now works as expected! 🎉
