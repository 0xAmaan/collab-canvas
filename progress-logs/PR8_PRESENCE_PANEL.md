# PR #8: Presence Panel & User List - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Branch:** `feat/presence-panel`

## Overview

Successfully implemented a Google Docs-style presence panel that displays all active users in the top-right corner of the dashboard. The panel shows circular avatars with user initials, online status badges, and a subtle border to distinguish the current user.

## Implementation Details

### 1. UI Components Created

#### Avatar Component (`components/ui/Avatar.tsx`)
- Reusable avatar component with image support
- Fallback to colored circle with initials
- Customizable size (default: 40px)
- Optional border styling for current user (2px gray-700 ring with offset)
- Uses Next.js Image component for optimization

#### Badge Component (`components/ui/Badge.tsx`)
- Small circular badge for status indicators
- Positioned at bottom-right of avatars
- Green dot for online status
- Simple, clean design with white ring border

### 2. Presence Components Created

#### UserAvatar Component (`components/presence/UserAvatar.tsx`)
- Wraps base Avatar component
- Displays online status badge
- Shows username on hover via title attribute
- Uses user's assigned color as background
- Accepts `isCurrentUser` prop for styling distinction
- Extracts first letter of username for initials

#### PresencePanel Component (`components/presence/PresencePanel.tsx`)
- Main container for user presence display
- Positioned in top-right corner of header
- Horizontal row of overlapping avatars (Google Docs style)
- Uses negative margin (`-space-x-2`) for overlap effect
- Shows up to 8 avatars by default, then "+N more" indicator
- Displays total user count on hover
- Maps through all active users from Convex

### 3. Hook Updates

#### usePresence Hook (`hooks/usePresence.ts`)
- Added `allUsers` to return value (includes current user)
- Kept `otherUsers` for cursor rendering (existing functionality)
- Both use same Convex query but filtered differently
- `allUsers` = all active users including current user
- `otherUsers` = all active users excluding current user

### 4. Dashboard Integration

#### DashboardClient (`app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`)
- Imported PresencePanel component
- Added usePresence hook with allUsers
- Positioned panel before zoom controls in header
- Passes currentUserId to identify which avatar to highlight
- Uses existing getUserColor utility for color assignment
- Integrated seamlessly with existing layout

## Key Design Decisions

### Visual Design
- **Position:** Top-right corner of header, inline with zoom controls
- **Style:** Overlapping circular avatars (Google Docs pattern)
- **Current User:** Subtle 2px gray-700 ring with offset instead of bold border
- **Colors:** Uses existing 3-color palette from getUserColor()
- **Size:** 36px avatars (slightly smaller than standard 40px for compact display)

### Functionality
- **Max Visible:** 8 avatars before showing overflow indicator
- **Overflow:** "+N more" gray badge when users exceed max
- **Tooltip:** Username shown on hover via native title attribute
- **Real-time:** Uses Convex subscription for instant updates
- **Status:** Green dot badge on all active users

### Implementation Philosophy
- **Simple First:** No complex animations or interactions
- **Performance:** Leverages existing Convex subscriptions
- **Reusable:** UI components can be used elsewhere
- **Accessible:** Title attributes for screen readers

## Files Created

1. ✅ `components/ui/Avatar.tsx` - Base avatar component
2. ✅ `components/ui/Badge.tsx` - Status badge component
3. ✅ `components/ui/index.ts` - UI components barrel export
4. ✅ `components/presence/UserAvatar.tsx` - Presence-specific avatar
5. ✅ `components/presence/PresencePanel.tsx` - Main panel container
6. ✅ `components/presence/index.ts` - Presence components barrel export

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `hooks/usePresence.ts` - Added allUsers to return value
2. ✅ `app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx` - Integrated PresencePanel
3. ✅ `context/tasklist.md` - Updated PR #8 status to complete

## Technical Highlights

### Component Architecture
```
PresencePanel (container)
  └── UserAvatar (per user)
      ├── Avatar (base component)
      └── Badge (status indicator)
```

### Data Flow
```
Convex presence.getActiveUsers
  ↓
usePresence hook (allUsers)
  ↓
DashboardClient
  ↓
PresencePanel
  ↓
UserAvatar (map)
```

### Styling Pattern
- Tailwind utility classes for layout
- Inline styles for dynamic colors
- Negative space for overlap effect
- Ring utilities for current user distinction

## Testing Checklist

Ready to test:
- [ ] Verify presence panel shows current user with subtle ring border
- [ ] Open second browser window → verify both users appear
- [ ] Verify user count updates in real-time
- [ ] Verify avatars display correctly with initials
- [ ] Verify online status indicator (green dot) is visible
- [ ] Verify cursor colors match between panel and canvas
- [ ] Close window → verify user disappears from panel
- [ ] Test with 10+ users to verify overflow "+N more" indicator

## Future Enhancements (Not in MVP)

1. **Clerk Profile Images:** Currently using initials only, can add Clerk imageUrl
2. **User Profiles:** Click avatar to see user details
3. **Filter/Search:** Search users when list is large
4. **Animations:** Smooth enter/exit animations for users
5. **Custom Tooltips:** Rich tooltips with more user info
6. **Activity Status:** Show what user is doing (creating, editing, etc.)

## Notes

- **No Mobile Responsiveness:** As requested, not prioritized for MVP
- **Simple Implementation:** Focused on core functionality over fancy features
- **Performance:** Uses existing Convex subscriptions, no additional overhead
- **Consistency:** Matches existing color scheme and design patterns
- **Extensibility:** Components are reusable and easy to enhance

## Next Steps

PR #8 is complete and ready for testing. The presence panel is now live in the dashboard. Next PR would be:
- **PR #9:** Keyboard Shortcuts (nice-to-have)
- **PR #10:** UI Polish (final touches)
- **PR #11:** Deployment (production setup)
