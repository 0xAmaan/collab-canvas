⏺ Perfect! Now I have a clear picture. Let me create a structured learning roadmap for you.

🗺️ CollabCanvas Deep Dive Learning Plan

Here's how we'll spend the next hour understanding your codebase from ground up:

---
Phase 1: Foundation Concepts (15 min)

Understanding the building blocks before diving into code

1.1 What is Middleware? (3 min)

- Real-world analogy: Security guard at a building entrance
- How it works in Next.js (runs BEFORE pages load)
- Your middleware: middleware.ts - Clerk authentication check

1.2 React Hooks Refresher (5 min)

- useState - Component memory
- useEffect - Side effects (API calls, subscriptions)
- useCallback - Function memoization (performance)
- useMemo - Value memoization
- useRef - Persistent values that don't trigger re-renders
- Why hooks matter in your app (real-time updates)

1.3 What is Convex? (7 min)

- Traditional backend vs Convex (why it's revolutionary)
- Real-time subscriptions (auto-updates without polling)
- Queries vs Mutations vs Actions
- How it integrates with your React app

---
Phase 2: Application Flow - Request Lifecycle (15 min)

Following a user request from start to finish

2.1 The Entry Points (5 min)

1. User visits /dashboard → middleware check → page loads
2. Root Layout wraps everything (Clerk + Convex providers)
3. How providers make data available to all components

2.2 Authentication Flow (5 min)

- Clerk: What it does, how it works
- Client-side: useUser() hook
- Server-side: Convex mutations checking ctx.auth
- Why you need both

2.3 Data Flow Diagram (5 min)

User Action → Component → Hook → Convex Mutation → Database
                ↑                                      ↓
                └──────── Convex Query ←──────────────┘
Walking through a real example: Creating a rectangle

---
Phase 3: Core Architecture Deep Dive (20 min)

Understanding how the pieces fit together

3.1 Canvas System (8 min)

- What is Fabric.js and why you need it
- Canvas.tsx - The orchestrator
- Initialization
- Event handlers (mouse events)
- Sync logic (Fabric ↔ Convex)
- Shape lifecycle: Create → Render → Update → Delete

3.2 Real-Time Multiplayer (7 min)

- Presence system architecture
- usePresence hook breakdown
- Join/Leave mechanics
- Heartbeat system (why it exists)
- Cron job cleanup (preventing ghost cursors)
- Cursor position sync (50ms throttle - why?)

3.3 State Management Pattern (5 min)

- No Redux/Zustand needed - Convex IS your state
- Optimistic updates (instant UI feedback)
- How conflicts are resolved
- Custom hooks as state managers (useShapes, usePresence)

---
Phase 4: Critical Code Walkthrough (15 min)

Reading actual code together with explanations

4.1 File by File Analysis (10 min)

We'll read and discuss:
1. convex/schema.ts - Database structure
2. convex/shapes.ts - Backend operations
3. hooks/useShapes.ts - Frontend integration
4. components/canvas/Canvas.tsx - Key sections

4.2 Performance Optimizations (5 min)

- Why throttling matters
- Batch rendering technique
- Direct DOM manipulation (avoiding React re-renders)
- Selective sync (don't update what user is dragging)

---
Phase 5: Practical Understanding (10 min)

Connecting theory to reality

5.1 Common Scenarios (5 min)

- "What happens when User A creates a shape?"
- "How does User B see it instantly?"
- "What if User B's internet is slow?"
- "Why do cursors disappear when tab is hidden?"

5.2 Debug Strategy (5 min)

- Where to look when things break
- Reading Convex dashboard logs
- Browser console patterns
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

---
Phase 6: Q&A & Experimentation (5 min)

Testing your understanding

- Quick quiz questions
- "What would happen if..." scenarios
- Areas you want to explore deeper
- Next steps for extending the app

---
🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end, you'll understand:
- ✅ How data flows from user action → database → all connected users
- ✅ Why each hook exists and what it manages
- ✅ How Convex eliminates traditional backend complexity
- ✅ Performance patterns and why they matter
- ✅ How to debug and extend the application confidently

Ready to start? Let me know if you want to:
1. Follow this plan exactly as laid out
2. Adjust focus areas (more hooks, less Convex, etc.)
3. Start with a specific part that confuses you most
