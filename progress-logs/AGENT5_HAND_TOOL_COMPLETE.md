# Agent 5: Hand/Pan Tool Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete  
**Agent**: Agent 5 (Hand/Pan Tool)

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Hand/Pan Tool as specified in the Figma UI Redesign Plan. The tool enables users to pan the canvas without selecting objects, working in both toggle mode (H key) and temporary mode (Spacebar hold).

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Keyboard Shortcuts (`constants/keyboard.ts`)
- ✅ Added `HAND_TOOL` to `KeyboardAction` enum
- ✅ Added hand tool shortcut configuration (H key)
- ✅ Shortcut automatically appears in help modal

### 2. Keyboard Hook (`hooks/useKeyboard.ts`)
- ✅ Added `onHandTool` callback for H key toggle
- ✅ Added `onSpacebarDown` callback for temporary mode
- ✅ Added `onSpacebarUp` callback to restore previous tool
- ✅ Implemented keydown handler with repeat prevention
- ✅ Implemented keyup handler for spacebar release

### 3. Canvas Component (`components/canvas/Canvas.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated tool mode effect to handle hand tool
- ✅ Set cursor to "grab" when hand tool active
- ✅ Disabled selection and object interaction in hand mode
- ✅ Added hand tool panning in mouse:down handler
- ✅ Updated mouse:up to reset cursor correctly

### 4. Dashboard Client (`app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `previousToolRef` to track previous tool
- ✅ Implemented `handleHandTool()` for H key toggle
- ✅ Implemented `handleSpacebarDown()` for temporary mode
- ✅ Implemented `handleSpacebarUp()` to restore previous tool
- ✅ Connected all callbacks to useKeyboard hook
- ✅ Added useEffect to update previousToolRef correctly

## Testing Results

### ✅ H Key Toggle Mode
- [x] Pressing 'H' activates hand tool
- [x] Pressing 'H' again deactivates (returns to select mode)
- [x] Cursor changes to "grab"
- [x] Objects cannot be selected
- [x] Can pan by clicking and dragging
- [x] Cursor changes to "grabbing" while panning

### ✅ Spacebar Temporary Mode
- [x] Holding Spacebar temporarily activates hand tool
- [x] Releasing Spacebar returns to previous tool
- [x] Works from any tool (select, rectangle, circle, etc.)
- [x] Previous tool correctly restored
- [x] No repeat triggering (e.repeat check)
- [x] Doesn't interfere with input fields

### ✅ Panning Behavior
- [x] Pan works by click-drag in hand mode
- [x] Objects are not selectable in hand mode
- [x] Zoom still works (scroll wheel)
- [x] Existing Alt+drag pan still works in select mode
- [x] Viewport updates smoothly

### ✅ Visual Feedback
- [x] Cursor: "grab" when hovering
- [x] Cursor: "grabbing" when panning
- [x] Toolbar highlights hand tool when active
- [x] Tool dropdown shows correct active tool

### ✅ Integration & Compatibility
- [x] No TypeScript errors introduced
- [x] All existing tools still work
- [x] Multiplayer cursors render correctly
- [x] Zoom controls function properly
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts help includes hand tool
- [x] No breaking changes to existing functionality

- ✅ Style: Follows project conventions (arrow functions)
- ✅ Comments: Clear explanations added
- ✅ Testing: All functionality verified

---

## Implementation Highlights

### Figma-Style Behavior
The implementation follows Figma's hand tool behavior exactly:
- **H key**: Toggle hand tool on/off (persistent mode)
- **Spacebar**: Temporary hand mode (hold to activate, release to return)
- **Visual feedback**: Grab cursor → grabbing cursor
- **Pan-only**: No object selection or interaction

### Smart Previous Tool Tracking
```typescript
// Only update previousToolRef when NOT switching to hand
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTool !== "hand") {
    previousToolRef.current = activeTool;
  }
}, [activeTool]);
```

This ensures that:
- Spacebar returns to the correct tool
- H key toggle doesn't break spacebar temporary mode
- Tool state is preserved correctly

### Cursor Management
```typescript
if (isHandMode) {
  canvas.defaultCursor = "grab";
  canvas.hoverCursor = "grab";
  // Changes to "grabbing" during mouse:down
}
```

### Selection Disabling
```typescript
canvas.getObjects().forEach((obj) => {
  if (isHandMode) {
    obj.selectable = false;
    obj.evented = false;
  }
});
```

## No Breaking Changes

- ✅ All existing tools work as before
- ✅ No changes to Convex schema
- ✅ No changes to shape types
- ✅ No changes to existing keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Select mode panning still works
- ✅ Zoom functionality preserved
- ✅ Multiplayer features intact

---

## Known Issues

**None** - Implementation is complete and working as specified.

(Pre-existing polygon type error is unrelated to hand tool implementation)

---

## DON'Ts Followed

✅ Did not modify shape creation logic  
✅ Did not change zoom implementation  
✅ Did not affect other tools  
✅ Did not implement advanced features (pressure sensitivity, custom cursors, etc.)

---

## Testing Checklist (from Plan)

All items from the Agent 5 testing checklist completed:

- [x] Clicking Hand tool in toolbar activates it
- [x] Pressing 'H' toggles hand tool
- [x] With hand active, can pan by click-drag
- [x] Cannot select shapes when hand active
- [x] Holding Spacebar temporarily activates hand
- [x] Releasing Spacebar returns to previous tool
- [x] Cursor changes to grab/grabbing appropriately
- [x] Zoom still works with hand tool active
- [x] Existing Alt+drag pan still works

---

## Conclusion

The Hand/Pan Tool implementation is **complete and production-ready**. All requirements from the FIGMA_UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ Hand tool in Selection Tools dropdown (already present in toolbar)
2. ✅ H key toggle functionality
3. ✅ Spacebar temporary mode (hold/release)
4. ✅ Pan-only interaction (no selection)
5. ✅ Cursor visual feedback (grab → grabbing)
6. ✅ Zoom compatibility
7. ✅ No conflicts with existing features

The implementation follows all project conventions, introduces no breaking changes, and is fully tested. Ready for integration with other agent implementations.

**Next Steps**: This implementation is ready to be tested with the other phases (Left Sidebar, Bottom Toolbar, Right Sidebar) when they are complete.
