# Pencil Tool Diagnostic Test

## What to Check

I've added diagnostic logs to identify exactly why the path isn't being saved. Follow these steps carefully:

---

## Step 1: Open Console & Activate Pencil
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Press **'P'** to activate pencil tool

### Expected Logs:
```
üé® PENCIL MODE ACTIVATED
  - Setting isDrawingMode = true
  - Brush color: #3b82f6
  - PencilBrush created and assigned
  - isDrawingMode: true
```

### ‚ùì Question 1:
**Do you see these logs when you press 'P'?** YES/NO

If NO - the tool isn't activating properly
If YES - continue to Step 2

---

## Step 2: Check Event Listener Registration
After pressing 'P', you should also see:

```
üìù Registering path:created event listener
‚úÖ path:created listener registered
```

### ‚ùì Question 2:
**Do you see the event listener registration logs?** YES/NO

If NO - the effect isn't running
If YES - continue to Step 3

---

## Step 3: Draw a Stroke
Draw a simple stroke on the canvas (click, drag, release)

### Expected Logs:
```
=== PATH CREATED EVENT START ===
[Path Created] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial path properties:
  - fill: ...
  - stroke: ...
  (etc, all 13 steps)
=== PATH CREATED EVENT END ===
```

### ‚ùì Question 3:
**Do you see the PATH CREATED logs after drawing?** YES/NO

If NO - The `path:created` event is NOT firing from Fabric.js
If YES - continue to Step 4

---

## Step 4: Check Database Save
If you saw all the path creation logs, look specifically for:

```
[Path Created] 8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ Saved! Real shapeId: [some-id]
```

### ‚ùì Question 4:
**Do you see step 8Ô∏è‚É£ with a shapeId?** YES/NO

If NO - Save to Convex is failing
If YES - The save succeeded!

---

## Step 5: Check for Errors
Look in the console for any RED error messages

### ‚ùì Question 5:
**Are there any error messages?** YES/NO

If YES - Copy the full error message

---

## Scenarios & What They Mean

### Scenario A: No logs at all
- Problem: Pencil mode isn't activating
- Tool isn't being set to "pencil" properly

### Scenario B: Pencil mode logs but no event listener logs
- Problem: Effect dependencies issue
- Event listener not registering

### Scenario C: Everything logs but no "PATH CREATED"
- **This is the critical issue!**
- Problem: Fabric.js PencilBrush isn't firing the event
- This means the brush isn't configured correctly

### Scenario D: PATH CREATED logs but no step 8Ô∏è‚É£
- Problem: Convex mutation is failing
- Check for error messages

---

## What to Report Back

Copy and paste from console:

1. **All logs from pressing 'P'**
2. **All logs from drawing (if any)**
3. **Any RED error messages**
4. **Answers to the 5 questions above**

---

## Quick Test Command

If you want to test Fabric.js directly, after pressing 'P', open console and type:

```javascript
canvas = document.querySelector('canvas').__fabric;
console.log('Canvas isDrawingMode:', canvas.isDrawingMode);
console.log('Canvas freeDrawingBrush:', canvas.freeDrawingBrush);
```

This will show if the canvas is actually in drawing mode.
