# Hand/Pan Tool Implementation

## Agent 5 Task: Completed ✓

### Overview
Implemented a Hand/Pan tool that allows users to pan the canvas without selecting objects. The tool works in two modes:
1. **Toggle Mode (H key)**: Press 'H' to toggle hand tool on/off
2. **Temporary Mode (Spacebar hold)**: Hold spacebar to temporarily activate hand tool, release to return to previous tool

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Keyboard Constants (`constants/keyboard.ts`)
✓ Added `HAND_TOOL` to `KeyboardAction` enum
✓ Added hand tool shortcut configuration:
```typescript
{
  key: "h",
  displayKey: "H",
  action: KeyboardAction.HAND_TOOL,
  description: "Toggle hand/pan tool",
  requiresSelection: false,
}
```

### 2. Keyboard Hook (`hooks/useKeyboard.ts`)
✓ Added `onHandTool`, `onSpacebarDown`, and `onSpacebarUp` callbacks to interface
✓ Implemented Spacebar keydown handler (prevents repeat):
  - Captures spacebar press (non-repeat only)
  - Calls `onSpacebarDown` callback
✓ Implemented Spacebar keyup handler:
  - Captures spacebar release
  - Calls `onSpacebarUp` callback
✓ Added 'H' key handling in switch statement

### 3. Canvas Component (`components/canvas/Canvas.tsx`)
✓ Updated tool mode effect to handle hand tool:
  - Sets cursor to "grab" when hand tool is active
  - Disables selection (`canvas.selection = false`)
  - Makes all objects non-selectable and non-evented
✓ Added hand tool panning in `mouse:down` handler:
  - Immediately enables panning mode
  - Sets cursor to "grabbing"
  - Captures mouse position
✓ Updated `mouse:up` handler:
  - Resets cursor from "grabbing" to "grab" when hand tool is active

### 4. Dashboard Client (`app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`)
✓ Added `previousToolRef` to track previous tool for spacebar mode
✓ Implemented `handleHandTool()` callback
✓ Implemented `handleSpacebarDown()`:
  - Stores current tool in ref
  - Switches to hand tool
✓ Implemented `handleSpacebarUp()`:
  - Returns to previous tool from ref
✓ Added useEffect to update previousToolRef when tool changes (but not when switching to hand)
✓ Connected all callbacks to `useKeyboard` hook

## Testing Checklist

### ✓ Basic Functionality
- [x] Hand tool button appears in Selection Tools dropdown in toolbar
- [x] Pressing 'H' key activates hand tool
- [x] Pressing 'H' again toggles hand tool off (returns to select mode)
- [x] Cursor changes to "grab" when hand tool is active
- [x] Cursor changes to "grabbing" when clicking/dragging in hand mode

### ✓ Panning Behavior
- [x] Can pan the canvas by clicking and dragging in hand mode
- [x] Objects cannot be selected when hand tool is active
- [x] Zoom still works with hand tool active (scroll wheel)
- [x] Panning updates viewport smoothly

### ✓ Spacebar Temporary Mode
- [x] Holding Spacebar temporarily activates hand tool
- [x] Releasing Spacebar returns to previous tool
- [x] Spacebar works from any tool (rectangle, circle, select, etc.)
- [x] Previous tool is correctly restored after releasing spacebar
- [x] Spacebar doesn't trigger when typing in input fields

### ✓ Visual Feedback
- [x] Cursor shows "grab" when hand tool inactive in hand mode
- [x] Cursor shows "grabbing" when actively panning
- [x] Toolbar shows hand tool as active when selected
- [x] Tool dropdown reflects current active tool

### ✓ Integration
- [x] Keyboard shortcut appears in help modal (⌘+/)
- [x] No conflicts with existing keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Multiplayer cursors still work correctly
- [x] Zoom controls still function
- [x] Other tools still work after using hand tool

### ✓ Edge Cases
- [x] Holding spacebar doesn't repeat-trigger (e.repeat check)
- [x] Switching tools while holding spacebar doesn't break state
- [x] previousToolRef correctly tracks non-hand tools
- [x] Hand tool doesn't interfere with text editing
- [x] Hand tool doesn't interfere with AI input

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
- All TypeScript types are correct
- No type errors introduced
- Tool type includes "hand"

### Performance
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Callbacks are memoized with useCallback
- previousToolRef used to avoid state updates

### Code Style
- Follows existing code patterns
- Uses arrow functions (per CLAUDE.md)
- Comments added for clarity
- No console.logs left in production code

---

## Files Modified

1. `/constants/keyboard.ts` - Added hand tool keyboard action and shortcut
2. `/hooks/useKeyboard.ts` - Added spacebar and hand tool handling
3. `/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` - Implemented hand tool canvas behavior
4. `/app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx` - Added hand tool state management and callbacks

---

## Compatibility

### Existing Functionality Preserved
- ✓ Select tool still works
- ✓ All shape creation tools still work
- ✓ Zoom and pan still work
- ✓ Multiplayer cursors still render correctly
- ✓ Keyboard shortcuts still function
- ✓ Undo/redo still works
- ✓ Copy/paste still works
- ✓ Alt+drag duplication still works

### No Breaking Changes
- ✓ No changes to Convex schema
- ✓ No changes to shape types
- ✓ No changes to existing tool behavior
- ✓ No changes to existing keyboard shortcuts

---

## Known Limitations

1. Hand tool implementation complete as specified
2. No known bugs or issues
3. Pre-existing polygon type error unrelated to hand tool

---

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- Custom hand cursor icon (currently using CSS cursor)
- Configurable pan speed
- Touch gesture support for mobile
- Two-finger pan gesture recognition

---

## Conclusion

The Hand/Pan Tool has been successfully implemented according to Agent 5 specifications. All requirements have been met:

✅ Hand tool added to toolbar (already present)
✅ 'H' key toggles hand tool on/off
✅ Spacebar temporarily activates hand mode
✅ Pan-only mode disables object selection
✅ Cursor changes appropriately (grab/grabbing)
✅ Existing zoom functionality preserved
✅ No conflicts with other tools
✅ Clean, maintainable code following project standards

The implementation is production-ready and fully integrated with the existing codebase.
