# Simplified Debug Logs - Pencil Tool Only

## What You'll See Now

I've commented out all the noisy sync logs. Now you'll ONLY see logs for:

### ‚úÖ When You Draw with Pencil Tool:

```
=== PATH CREATED EVENT START ===
[Path Created] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial path properties:
  - fill: [VALUE]
  - stroke: [COLOR]
  - strokeWidth: [NUMBER]
  - left: [X]
  - top: [Y]
  - width: [W]
  - height: [H]
  - path data: [ARRAY]

[Path Created] 2Ô∏è‚É£ Generated temp ID: temp_path_[TIMESTAMP]

[Path Created] 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tagging path with temp ID and marking as saving...

[Path Created] 4Ô∏è‚É£ Current saving shapes: [Array]

[Path Created] 5Ô∏è‚É£ Serialized path data length: [NUMBER]

[Path Created] 6Ô∏è‚É£ Shape data to save: {object}

[Path Created] 7Ô∏è‚É£ Calling Convex mutation...

[Path Created] 8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚úÖ Saved! Real shapeId: [ID]

[Path Created] 9Ô∏è‚É£ Removed temp ID from saving set

[Path Created] üîü Updated path with real shapeId: [ID]

[Path Created] 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Added real ID to saving set temporarily

[Path Created] 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Canvas re-rendered

=== PATH CREATED EVENT END ===
```

### ‚úÖ When Sync Adds a New Shape:

```
[Sync] ‚úÖ Adding NEW shape [ID] (path) to canvas
```

### ‚úÖ When Sync Removes Something (IMPORTANT):

```
[Sync] ‚ùå REMOVING object with shapeId: [ID]
```

## What I Commented Out

All these logs are now silent (but still in code as comments):
- ‚ùå Sync effect start/end markers
- ‚ùå Shapes from DB count
- ‚ùå Canvas objects count
- ‚ùå Found canvas object logs (every single object)
- ‚ùå Object update checks
- ‚ùå Skipping update logs
- ‚ùå Checking for objects to remove

---

## Testing Steps (Simplified)

1. **Open console** (F12)
2. **Press 'P'** to activate pencil
3. **Draw a stroke**
4. **Look for**:
   - The 13 numbered path creation steps
   - Step 8Ô∏è‚É£ should say "‚úÖ Saved! Real shapeId:"
   - If it disappears, you should see "‚ùå REMOVING object"

## Quick Questions to Answer

After drawing, tell me:

1. **Did you see all 13 numbered steps?** YES/NO
2. **Did step 8Ô∏è‚É£ appear?** YES/NO
3. **Did you see "‚ùå REMOVING object"?** YES/NO
4. **Does the path stay on canvas?** YES/NO
5. **Is the path filled or stroke-only?** FILLED/STROKE
6. **After refresh, is it there?** YES/NO

## Copy Just the Path Logs

When you draw, select and copy from:
```
=== PATH CREATED EVENT START ===
```
to:
```
=== PATH CREATED EVENT END ===
```

And any REMOVING messages if you see them!
