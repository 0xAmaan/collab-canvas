# ✅ PR #2: Authentication & Route Structure - COMPLETE

## 🎉 What's Been Done

### 1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration** ✅
- Configured custom color palette using `@theme inline` in `globals.css`
- Added blue, purple, red color scheme for canvas app
- Added canvas-specific styles
- **Colors available:**
  - `bg-canvas-blue`, `text-canvas-blue`, etc.
  - `bg-canvas-purple`, `text-canvas-purple`, etc.
  - `bg-canvas-red`, `text-canvas-red`, etc.

### 2. **Convex + Clerk Integration** ✅
- Created `convex/auth.config.ts` - bridges Clerk JWT auth to Convex
- Created `convex/schema.ts` - defined database tables:
  - `shapes` table (for rectangles)
  - `presence` table (for user cursors/online status)
- **Action Required:** Add `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` to your `.env` file

### 3. **Beautiful Landing Page** ✅
- Gradient hero section with custom colors
- Feature showcase cards
- "Get Started" CTA button that opens Clerk sign-in modal
- **Smart redirect:** Authenticated users automatically go to `/dashboard`

### 4. **Protected Dashboard Page** ✅
- Only accessible to authenticated users
- Top navigation bar with app branding
- Canvas placeholder with preview cards
- Personalized welcome message
- Ready for canvas implementation (PR #4)

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable

Add this to your `.env` file (see `CONVEX_SETUP.md` for details):

```bash
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=your-app-name.clerk.accounts.dev
```

Get this from: Clerk Dashboard → Configure → JWT Templates → Convex

### Step 2: Restart Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1: Convex
bunx convex dev

# Terminal 2: Next.js
bun run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. **Visit:** `http://localhost:3000`
   - ✅ You should see the beautiful landing page
   - ✅ Click "Get Started" to open sign-in modal

2. **Sign Up/Sign In**
   - ✅ Create an account or sign in
   - ✅ After auth, you should auto-redirect to `/dashboard`

3. **Dashboard**
   - ✅ You should see "Welcome, [Your Name]!"
   - ✅ Canvas placeholder is visible
   - ✅ Try opening `/` again - should auto-redirect back to `/dashboard`

4. **Sign Out**
   - ✅ Click your user button in the header (top right)
   - ✅ Sign out
   - ✅ Should redirect back to landing page

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `convex/auth.config.ts` - Clerk auth integration
- `convex/schema.ts` - Database schema
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Protected dashboard
- `CONVEX_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions
- `PR2_COMPLETE.md` - This file!

### Modified Files:
- `app/globals.css` - Added Tailwind v4 theme config
- `app/page.tsx` - Beautiful landing page with redirect
- `app/layout.tsx` - Already had Clerk components

## 🎯 What's Next: PR #3

Now that auth is complete, the next phase is to implement the Convex backend:

### PR #3: Database Schema & Convex Setup

You already have the schema defined! Now you need to create:

1. **Shape Mutations** (`convex/shapes.ts`):
   - `createShape` - Create rectangles
   - `updateShape` - Update properties
   - `moveShape` - Move position
   - `deleteShape` - Delete shapes

2. **Shape Queries** (`convex/shapes.ts`):
   - `getShapes` - Get all shapes
   - `getShape` - Get single shape

3. **Presence Mutations** (`convex/presence.ts`):
   - `updatePresence` - Update cursor position
   - `joinCanvas` - User joins
   - `leaveCanvas` - User leaves
   - `heartbeat` - Keep alive

4. **Presence Queries** (`convex/presence.ts`):
   - `getActiveUsers` - Get online users
   - `getUserPresence` - Get specific user

5. **Cron Job** (`convex/crons.ts`):
   - Clean up stale presence records

## 🎨 Current App State

### What Works:
✅ Authentication (Clerk)  
✅ Landing page with auto-redirect  
✅ Protected dashboard route  
✅ Tailwind v4 with custom colors  
✅ Convex initialized and connected  
✅ Database schema defined  

### What's Coming:
⏳ Convex queries/mutations (PR #3)  
⏳ Canvas with pan/zoom (PR #4)  
⏳ Shape creation (PR #5)  
⏳ Real-time sync (PR #6)  
⏳ Multiplayer cursors (PR #7)

## 📊 Progress Tracker

- ✅ **PR #1:** Project Setup
- ✅ **PR #2:** Authentication & Routes **← YOU ARE HERE**
- ⏳ **PR #3:** Database Schema (schema done, needs functions)
- ⏳ **PR #4:** Canvas Viewport
- ⏳ **PR #5:** Shape Creation
- ⏳ **PR #6:** Real-time Sync
- ⏳ **PR #7:** Multiplayer Cursors
- ⏳ **PR #8:** Presence Panel

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthenticated" errors
- Make sure `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` is in `.env`
- Restart both Convex and Next.js dev servers

### Issue: Landing page not redirecting
- Clear browser cache/cookies
- Check if Clerk sign-in worked (check Clerk dashboard for users)

### Issue: Dashboard shows error
- Make sure you're signed in
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Tailwind colors not working
- Make sure dev server restarted after `globals.css` changes
- Use `text-canvas-blue` not `text-blue-canvas`

## 🎓 What You Learned

1. **Tailwind v4** uses `@theme inline` in CSS (no more config file!)
2. **Convex auth** requires JWT issuer domain from Clerk
3. **Protected routes** use `auth()` + `redirect()` in Next.js 15
4. **Database schema** is defined once, Convex generates types
