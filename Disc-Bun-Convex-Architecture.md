> This is less of a current bug but an architecture discussion that I want to address and go over in depth to 
properly understand and figure out the performance optimization.

I think that we're still optimistically creating an object before it sinks to convex, and I just want to address 
and understand the proper flow in terms of creating any object like text, or a rectangle, or a circle, and what 
that flow looks like right now.

Like when I click and drag to create a rectangle and then release it on the canvas, are we creating a temporary 
object and then waiting for it to sink to convex and then deleting, or are we just waiting for convex to sink it?

I would like to understand that better. I'd also like to understand the difference between convex and Real-time DB
 to understand the differences and trade-offs, because convex doesn't feel like a live sync for this type of 
editor, and I want to understand what makes real-time better for these live sync applications.

Convex does have the web socket and the live sync, so I'm not sure what the issue is in terms of smoothness of 
performance when I'm creating multiple objects in different windows and trying to see the performance across both 
of them, because it feels laggy.

So I want to understand how I can optimize that to really be performant. 

can you help me plan and work through this properly? i need to figure out how to do better here. you can use 
context7 mcp to read through the docs as well to understand it. i was also considering building/using Bun 
Websockets potentially for the live sync but am not entirely sure how it'd interact or if its the best approach. 
am just trying to think through this properly. read the docs for all 3 ideally

  Current Architecture Analysis

  Shape Creation Flow (Your Question)

  Here's exactly what happens when you create a rectangle:

  1. Mouse Down (useShapeCreationTool.ts:23-39):
    - Creates a temporary Fabric.js object immediately
    - Adds it to canvas with selectable: false
    - This object lives only on your local canvas (NOT in Convex yet)
  2. Mouse Move (useShapeCreationTool.ts:42-60):
    - Updates the temporary object's size in real-time
    - Still local only - no network calls
  3. Mouse Up (useShapeCreationTool.ts:63-118):
    - Makes the object selectable and visible
    - Calls finalizeShape() asynchronously
    - Key: The Fabric object stays on canvas while saving
  4. Finalize Shape (shape-finalizers.ts:21-73):
    - Sends mutation to Convex via createShape()
    - Links the returned shapeId to the Fabric object via object.set("data", { shapeId })
    - Does NOT remove the object
  5. Optimistic Update (useShapes.ts:132-208):
    - Adds a temporary shape to optimisticShapes array with _isOptimistic: true
    - This creates a duplicate briefly (Fabric object + optimistic shape)
    - When Convex confirms, optimistic shape is removed
    - The Fabric object with linked shapeId remains
  6. Sync Back (Canvas.tsx:816-826):
    - When Convex broadcasts the new shape, sync logic checks:
        - If object already exists with that shapeId → updates it (no-op in creation case)
      - If not → creates new Fabric object

  The Problem: Double Rendering

  You currently have a race condition:

  1. You create a Fabric rect → it appears immediately ✅
  2. You send to Convex with optimistic update → second rect appears ❌
  3. Convex confirms → optimistic removed, original rect gets shapeId linked
  4. Convex broadcasts to other clients → they see it for the first time

  For remote users: They see 50-100ms delay (Convex WebSocket latency) plus sync processing time.

  Performance Bottlenecks

  1. Convex Real-Time Architecture

  From the docs and research:

  - Convex uses WebSockets for real-time sync (good!)
  - Latency: ~50-100ms round trip for mutations
  - Optimistic updates are manual - you need to implement them yourself
  - Query subscriptions auto-update but only after mutation completes

  Comparison:
  - Firebase Realtime Database: ~600ms latency
  - Firestore: ~1500ms latency
  - Raw WebSockets: <10ms latency (no database, just message passing)

  2. Your Current Sync Pattern Issues

  In Canvas.tsx sync (lines 790-852):

  // Problem 1: Full reconciliation on every shape change
  shapes.forEach((shape) => {
    const fabricObj = fabricCanvas.getObjects().find(/* ... */);
    if (fabricObj) {
      updateFabricRect(fabricObj, shape); // Updates even if no change
    } else {
      const fabricRect = createFabricRect(shape);
      fabricCanvas.add(fabricRect);
    }
  });

  Issues:
  - ❌ Iterates through ALL shapes on every update
  - ❌ No change detection - updates even if nothing changed
  - ❌ savingShapesRef check is good, but still does unnecessary work
  - ❌ Batching is good (renderOnAddRemove = false), but still processes all shapes

  In useShapes.ts optimistic updates:

  // Problem 2: Optimistic shapes create duplicates
  const optimisticShape = {
    ...shape,
    _id: tempId,
    _isOptimistic: true,
  };
  setOptimisticShapes((prev) => [...prev, optimisticShape]);

  This causes:
  - ❌ Shape exists as Fabric object
  - ❌ Shape exists in optimisticShapes array
  - ❌ Sync tries to render optimistic shape → duplicate
  - ❌ Need complex filtering to prevent double-render

  3. Convex-Specific Limitations

  From documentation:

  - No partial updates - queries re-run entirely on any change
  - No delta/patch support - you get the full dataset each time
  - Automatic reactivity is broad - can't subscribe to "only shape X"
  - Write conflicts possible with high concurrency (optimistic concurrency control)

  Alternative Approaches

  Option 1: Pure Bun WebSockets (Custom Backend)

  Architecture:
  Client 1 ──┐
             ├──> Bun WS Server (pub/sub) ──> All Clients (broadcast)
  Client 2 ──┘         │
                       └──> PostgreSQL (persistence, optional)

  Pros:
  - ✅ <10ms latency for live updates
  - ✅ Direct message passing - no query re-running
  - ✅ Full control over message format and batching
  - ✅ Pub/sub built-in (ws.subscribe(), server.publish())
  - ✅ Extremely fast - Bun is 4x faster than Node.js

  Cons:
  - ❌ Build everything yourself - auth, persistence, conflict resolution
  - ❌ More code to maintain - mutations, queries, presence system
  - ❌ No automatic reactivity - manual state management
  - ❌ Need separate database for persistence (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
  - ❌ Deployment complexity - need to host Bun server separately

  Best For: Production apps needing sub-10ms latency (Google Docs-level)

  ---
  Option 2: Hybrid Convex + Bun WebSockets

  Architecture:
  Client 1 ──┐
             ├──> Bun WS (live sync) ──> All Clients
  Client 2 ──┘         │
                       └──> Convex (persistence, auth, cron jobs)

  Flow:
  1. User creates shape → broadcast via Bun WS (instant)
  2. Asynchronously persist to Convex (background)
  3. On reconnect/refresh → fetch from Convex

  Pros:
  - ✅ Best of both worlds - fast sync + robust backend
  - ✅ Keep Convex benefits - auth, crons, queries, schema
  - ✅ Reduce Convex load - fewer mutations for transient actions (cursor, drag)
  - ✅ <10ms updates for active sessions

  Cons:
  - ❌ Complex architecture - two systems to coordinate
  - ❌ Consistency challenges - WS and Convex can drift
  - ❌ More code - need to decide what goes where
  - ❌ Deployment complexity - two services to host

  Best For: Apps that need both speed AND Convex's features

  ---
  Option 3: Optimized Convex (Recommended Starting Point)

  Architecture: Keep Convex, but fix the performance issues

  Changes:

  1. Remove optimistic updates for shapes - they cause duplicates
  2. Add change detection - only update Fabric if data changed
  3. Index shapes by ID - O(1) lookup instead of O(n)
  4. Batch mutations - send multiple shape updates in one call
  5. Debounce high-frequency updates - already done for moves (100ms)
  6. Use Convex optimistic updates correctly - via withOptimisticUpdate()

  Pros:
  - ✅ Simple - no new infrastructure
  - ✅ Minimal code changes - optimize existing patterns
  - ✅ Keep Convex benefits - auth, schema, crons, real-time
  - ✅ Good enough for most apps - 50-100ms is acceptable

  Cons:
  - ❌ Can't beat physics - Convex has inherent 50-100ms latency
  - ❌ Still doing full query re-runs - Convex limitation
  - ❌ Won't feel as smooth as Google Docs

  Best For: MVP, early-stage apps, or when Convex's benefits outweigh latency

  Recommendation: Phased Approach

  Phase 1: Optimize Current Convex Implementation (1-2 days)

  Fix the low-hanging fruit:

  1. Remove duplicate rendering - don't use optimistic shapes for creation
  2. Add change detection - only update Fabric if shape data changed
  3. Index Fabric objects by shapeId - faster lookups
  4. Use Convex's withOptimisticUpdate() properly - update query results, not separate state

  Expected Result: Reduce lag from ~200-300ms to ~80-120ms

  ---
  Phase 2: Evaluate Performance (1 day)

  Test with:
  - 2-3 concurrent users creating shapes rapidly
  - Measure time from mouse-up to remote render
  - Check if 80-120ms feels acceptable

  Decision point:
  - ✅ If acceptable → ship it, monitor in production
  - ❌ If not → proceed to Phase 3

  ---
  Phase 3: Add Bun WebSockets (if needed) (3-5 days)

  Hybrid approach:

  1. Keep Convex for:
    - Persistence (shapes, presence)
    - Authentication (Clerk integration)
    - Cron jobs (cleanup)
    - Initial load (fetch all shapes)
  2. Add Bun WS for:
    - Live shape creation/updates (broadcast)
    - Cursor positions (already throttled to 50ms)
    - Drag operations (throttled to 100ms)
  3. Sync strategy:
    - WS update → apply to Fabric immediately
    - Debounced background save to Convex (500ms after last change)
    - On reconnect → reconcile WS state with Convex (Convex is source of truth)

  Expected Result: <20ms latency for live updates

  My Recommendation

⏺ Start with Phase 1 (Optimize Convex) because:

  1. It's the fastest path - 1-2 days vs 1+ week for WebSockets
  2. It might be good enough - 80-120ms is acceptable for most collaborative tools
  3. It's lower risk - no new infrastructure to maintain
  4. You learn more - understand actual performance needs before over-engineering

  Then decide:
  - If 80-120ms feels smooth → done! Ship it.
  - If it feels laggy → you now have data to justify Bun WS investment

  Only go to Bun WebSockets if:
  - You're targeting Google Docs-level smoothness
  - You have 3-5 days to build it properly
  - You're comfortable managing a separate WS server
  - 50-100ms latency is measurably hurting UX in user testing

  Next Steps

  Would you like me to:

  1. Implement Phase 1 optimizations (fix Convex performance issues)
  2. Build a Bun WebSocket POC (test latency before committing)
  3. Create a hybrid architecture plan (detailed implementation guide)
  4. Just review the specific code that's causing the duplicate rendering

  Which approach resonates with you? I'm happy to dive into implementation once you decide the direction!
